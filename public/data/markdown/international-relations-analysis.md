**2. Evolving Trends Over the Years**

**a. Shift from Definitions to Critical Analysis**

- **Trend:**

  - **2000:** Emphasis on definitions and establishing the scope (e.g.,
    Q1 in 2000).

  - **2001--2004:** Increase in analytical and critical questions (e.g.,
    American foreign policy in 2001; President Bush's actions in 2003).

- **Implication:**

  - Students must first master the foundational definitions before
    moving to complex, evidence-based analyses.

 **2006:** The focus is on explaining and contrasting major IR theories
(Neo-Realism vs. Classical Realism; Neo-Liberalism vs. Classical
Liberalism/Idealism).

-  **2007--2009:** Papers increasingly demand critical evaluation of
  foreign policies (e.g., U.S. policy, nuclear proliferation) and the
  impact of historical events on current international relations.

-  **2010:**\
  -- **Q.2:** "Can you imagine a world without Inter‑State Relations?
  Explain the importance of International Relations in the Nuclear
  Age."\
  *Emphasis on establishing foundational scope and relevance.*

-  **2011--2013:**\
  -- **2011, Q.1 (MCQs):** Focus on theoretical literature (e.g.,
  authors like Fukuyama, Carr).\
  -- **2013, Q.8:** "Explain why, despite being a target of terrorism,
  Pakistan's international allies often express dissatisfaction with
  Pakistan's counter terrorism policy..."\

  internationalist and realist theories? ..."\
  *Focus on comparative theoretical analysis as well as current regional
  issues in Q.7 and Q.8.*

**b. Emphasis on Comparative Analysis and Multidisciplinary
Perspectives**

- **Trend:**

  - Frequent comparative questions such as globalization vs.
    regionalism (2002) and economic versus political pressures (2000,
    2001).

  - Multidisciplinary analysis is increasingly required.

 Questions require comparisons across diverse dimensions---for example,
comparing theoretical schools in 2006 and later evaluating the
implications of the Cold War (2009).

-  Economic theories are blended with political analysis (e.g., trade
  linkages, economic imperialism).

- **Implication:**

  - Develop skills to compare different theories and policies using both
    historical and contemporary evidence.

 **2010:**\
-- **Q.6:** "Explain the Socio‑Economic and Political Compulsions which
led to the formation of Regional Blocs."\
*Bridges economic and political dimensions.*

  dynamics of Pakistan‑India relations in the context of Pakistan's

  United States."\
  *Requires multidisciplinary analysis (political, economic,
  strategic).*

<!-- -->

-  Early in **2018**, questions (Q.2, Q.3) focus on the evolution of IR
  as an academic discipline and on comparing foundational IR theories
  (Neo‑Realism vs. Constructivism).

- In **2021** and **2023**, comparative questions expand to include
  broader theoretical debates (modernist vs. post‑modernist approaches,
  Constructivism vs. Realism) and include contemporary issues.

**b. Security and Economic Dimensions in Foreign Policy**
