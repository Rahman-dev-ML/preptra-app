      "content": "Balochi language serves as a cornerstone of Baloch cultural identity and national consciousness. As one of Pakistan's major regional languages, it carries the responsibility of preserving cultural heritage while adapting to modern needs.\n\nThe language faces challenges of standardization, script unification (Arabic vs. Roman), and integration into educational systems. UNESCO recognizes the importance of multilingual education for cultural preservation and cognitive development.\n\nNational responsibility involves promoting Balochi in education, media, and administration while ensuring its speakers have equal opportunities in national discourse. The Balochi Academy Quetta plays a crucial role in standardization and literary promotion.",
