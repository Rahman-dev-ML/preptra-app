      "content": "Definition and scope of risk analysis for environmental decision-making. The canonical NRC/EPA paradigm: (1) Hazard Identification → does the stressor cause harm? (2) Dose–Response Assessment → quantify exposure–effect relation; (3) Exposure Assessment → magnitude, frequency, duration, routes; (4) Risk Characterization → integrate evidence, uncertainty, and describe risk. Risk management and risk communication are complementary (e.g., EPA's SALT framework and 'Seven Cardinal Rules').",
      "keyTakeaways": [
        "Know the four steps and the distinct outputs of each.",
        "Separate science (assessment) from policy (management).",
        "Plan early for communication; engage stakeholders throughout."
